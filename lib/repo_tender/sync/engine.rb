module RepoTender
  module Sync
    # The sync engine: one run that brings every tracked repo to the
    # evergreen invariant (PRD §3.3). Splits observation (RepoPlan)
    # from execution (this class). Bounded by Async::Semaphore
    # (config.concurrency) inside one Sync{} block. A single repo's
    # Failure does NOT abort the run — it is captured, the state row
    # is written as status: error, and the run continues.
    #
    # Slice 2 gate wiring:
    #   G7  — Async::Semaphore(concurrency) bounds the in-flight count.
    #   G8  — every processed repo gets a state row; failures are
    #         recorded with status: error + last_error.
    #   G9  — second run on a fresh set performs no network calls
    #         (the :skip_fresh plan short-circuits the SCM.fetch).
    #   G10 — OrgRef expansion via the injected forge; an org-list
    #         Failure is recorded and does not abort the run.
    #
    # sync-startup gate wiring (GS1–GS6):
    #   GS1 — expand_orgs fans org listings out concurrently via
    #         Async::Barrier + Async::Semaphore(config.concurrency).
    #   GS2 — forge.check_authenticated called ONCE before fan-out;
    #         on auth Failure all orgs recorded failed, no list_org.
    #   GS3 — CF3 / G10 resilience preserved (per-org failure isolated,
    #         prior repo_count/last_listed_at preserved on failure).
    #   GS4 — reporter events: attach → listing_started → org_listed*
    #         → listing_finished → run_started → repo* → run_finished
    #         → detach.
