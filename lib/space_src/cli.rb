  # CLI surface — thin translation layer between argv and the
  # existing Config::Store / State::Store / Sync::Engine boundaries.
  #
  # The CLI never mutates a git repo directly; repo mutation happens
  # inside the engine, which already upholds the no-data-loss
  # invariant (PRD §1). The CLI's job is:
  #   1. parse argv (via Dry::CLI's nested `register`)
  #   2. load/mutate validated config (Config::Store) OR delegate to
  #      the engine / state store
  #   3. translate Result to: out/err message + exit code
  #
  # Exit-code seam: each command records an `Outcome(exit_code:,
  # message:)` (the thread-local stash) and writes the user-facing
  # message to `out`/`err` via the injected IOs. The `exe/src`
  # entrypoint reads the recorded Outcome and calls Kernel.exit with
  # the code — see CLI.run below. Tests can inspect last_outcome
  # in-process (no subprocess needed for unit tests); a subprocess
  # Open3.capture3 covers the G3 "real exit" proof.
  module CLI
    # The Outcome value object. `exit_code` is 0 for success and 1
    # for Failure-derived failures. `message` is the user-facing
    # explanation already written to err (kept here so the
    # entrypoint could log/record it in a future slice).

    # forms here; a *leaf* help like `sync --help` (argv ["sync",
    # "--help"]) and a *group* like `repo` / `repo --help` are NOT

    # dispatch (most commonly: a SIGINT during a long-running
    # `Shell.run`, e.g. at a `git` username prompt or mid-clone) is
    # caught here and mapped to a clean exit code 130 (128 + SIGINT)
    # with a single human line on stderr — the G2 ^C-hygiene fix
