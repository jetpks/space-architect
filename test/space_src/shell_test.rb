  # Slice 6 G3 — Open3 reader-thread noise suppression (mechanism
  # justification). Open3.capture3's internal stdout/stderr reader
  # threads can raise `IOError: stream closed in another thread` if
  # the main thread is interrupted while they are mid-read (the
  # ^C-during-a-clone scenario from the field defect). With
  # `Thread.report_on_exception = true` (the default since Ruby
  # 2.5), Ruby prints a multi-line backtrace for that orphaned
  # thread. The fix brackets the `Open3.capture3` call in `Shell.run`
  # with a save/restore of `Thread.report_on_exception = false`.
  #
  # This test pins the mechanism: it asserts that, during the
  # `Open3.capture3` call, `Thread.report_on_exception` is observed
  # to be `false`, and that the original value is restored after
  # the call returns (success or failure). The shim around
  # `Open3.capture3` records the value from inside the call site.
